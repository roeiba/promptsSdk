<hr/>

promptsSDK is an experimental open-source Python library that provides modular GPT4 prompt engineering capabilities. By breaking down promptsGPT architecture into microprompts, each method is designed to execute a single task in a perfect way with repeatable results. The library aims to make it easier to accomplish complex tasks, such as generating marketing pages, landing pages, reviewing local code, creating tests for projects, and even building full Java applications or mobile APKs.

The library supports multiple AI engines, including using openAi keys and also a completely free option using [RevchatGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT).
In addition, it aims to use tools such as [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) in order to leverage the promptSDK.
